## Ideas (Unprioritized)

These are potential directions. None have user stories or acceptance criteria yet.

- **Heatmaps**: Click and scroll heatmaps (requires additional JS)
- **Session recordings**: Replay individual visitor sessions
- **A/B testing**: Built-in A/B test framework
- **Alerting**: Custom alert beyond rules spike notifications
- **Dashboard sharing**: Public share links with passwords
- **Annotations**: Mark events on timeline (e.g., "site redesign")
- **Custom reports**: Report builder with drag-drop metrics
- **Mobile app**: Native iOS/Android apps

## Won't Have

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Ads or selling user data | Privacy-first is core value proposition |
| Personal profiles | Maintains privacy commitment |
| Cross-site tracking | Violates privacy principles |
| Fingerprinting | Violates privacy principles |
| IP address storage | Violates privacy principles |
| Cookie consent banners | Cookie-less by design - not needed |
| Personal data export (GDPR) | No personal data stored |
| Real-time session replay | Privacy concerns |
