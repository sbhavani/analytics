# Contracts

API contracts for this feature are embedded in `data-model.md` under the "API Contracts" section.

This is an internal web application feature that extends existing segment functionality. External API contracts are not required since:

1. The feature is user-facing within the dashboard
2. Existing segment API is used with extended capabilities
3. No new external interfaces are exposed

For implementation, refer to:
- `data-model.md` - Data structures and validation rules
- `research.md` - Design decisions and rationale
- `quickstart.md` - Development setup and key files
